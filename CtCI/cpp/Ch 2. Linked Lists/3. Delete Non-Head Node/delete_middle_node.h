 * @brief Deleting a node in the middle means its note the list head or tail node.

 * First copy its value and neighboor information, and then delete the neighboor.
 * As we're using smart pointers for the next pointer it is pretty straightforward to avoid memory leaks
 * Time Complexity O(1)
 * Space Complexity O(1)
